# Hi, I’m Priyansh Keer

I’m a Computer Science undergraduate (2022–2026) with a strong interest in backend development, system design, and building real-world software systems. I enjoy working close to the core of applications — designing APIs, structuring data flows, and making systems scalable and reliable.

I believe learning happens best when theory meets practice. That mindset has pushed me to work on full-stack and backend-heavy projects involving microservices, AI-powered applications, and distributed system components.

## What I’m Interested In

- Backend engineering and API design  
- Distributed systems and microservices  
- Writing clean, maintainable, and scalable code  
- Understanding how large systems work end to end  

I like diving deep into problems, breaking them down, and building solutions step by step.

## Projects I’ve Worked On

**QuickAI – AI SaaS Application**  
A full-stack AI platform built using React, Node.js, Express, and PostgreSQL.  
It provides multiple AI-powered tools such as content generation, image processing, and resume analysis with secure authentication and subscription-based access control.

**Social Media Microservices Backend**  
Designed a microservices-based backend architecture using Node.js, Express, Redis, and RabbitMQ.  
Focused on service separation, asynchronous communication, caching strategies, and centralized API routing.

**Lecture-to-Assessment Synthesis Pipeline (Team Project)**  
Collaborated on an NLP-based system that converts lecture content into automated assessments.  
Worked on backend and API integration while coordinating with ML components using transformer-based models.

## Technical Focus

- **Languages:** C++, JavaScript, TypeScript  
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js, GraphQL, REST APIs  
- **Databases:** PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis  
- **Frontend:** React.js, Next.js, Tailwind CSS  
- **Tools:** Git, Docker, RabbitMQ, Postman, GitHub Actions  

I also actively practice **Data Structures and Algorithms** and have solved 350+ problems on LeetCode to strengthen my problem-solving fundamentals.

## Beyond Code

Outside of academics and development:
- I enjoy **sports**, especially football, which has helped me build discipline, teamwork, and mental resilience.
- I’m interested in **vlogging and presentation**, which has improved my communication and confidence.
- I value consistency, curiosity, and continuous improvement over shortcuts.

## What I’m Looking For

I’m currently preparing for software engineering roles and looking for opportunities where I can:
- Learn from real-world systems  
- Work in collaborative team environments  
- Contribute meaningfully while growing as an engineer  

I’m always open to learning, feedback, and challenging problems.
